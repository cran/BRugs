Some tools have been developed to copy the files needed for the run time and source version of OpenBUGS to seperate directories. These tools are in the module DevDistribute and their dialog boxes are in directory Dev/Rsrc (see section on Setting up BlackBox).<br><br>These tools can also translate the OpenBUGS documentation from the odc format into html if appropiate. Plain ascii text versions of the examples are also created for the run time distribution. As an option the source code distribution can contain source code files as plain text files with the extension cp. If you want to work with these cp text files you will have to continue the modification of the Component Pascal compiler in subsystem Lindev to have a file based interface and maybe integrate this with EMACS. In the section on setting up BlackBox it is explained how to set up menu items for these tools. <br><br>The OpenBUGS software uses several shortcuts / scripts, the directory paths in these files depend on where the OpenBUGS software is installed and might need editing. </font><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF" size="3"><br></font></p></body></html>
